### 🌍 **World Economic Data - Complete Data Analysis**

This project is an end-to-end data analysis of global economic indicators, exploring cost of living, corruption index, and quality of life metrics across countries. The goal is to reveal insights and patterns that help understand the global economic landscape using statistical analysis and data visualization.

### 📌 **Project Objectives**

* Analyze and compare economic indicators across countries.
* Correlate the cost of living, rent index, groceries index, and local purchasing power.
* Explore corruption perceptions across nations.
* Use visualizations to detect trends and outliers.
* Build a clean and structured dataset ready for machine learning or BI applications.

---

### 🧠 **Key Insights**

* Countries with high local purchasing power often have lower rent-to-income ratios.
* There’s a noticeable inverse correlation between corruption index and quality of life in certain regions.
* European countries generally show a strong balance between the cost of living and quality of life.
